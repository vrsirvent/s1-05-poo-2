Level 1 - Exercise 2
  
Apply the use of abstract classes and interfaces in PHP.

## Description
Write a program that defines a Shape class with a constructor that receives the width and height as parameters. Define two subclasses, Triangle and Rectangle, that inherit from Shape and calculate the area of the figure, respectively.

Important! - Yes, it is the same exercise as in POO1, but here we need you to solve it by applying some of the concepts from the POO2 topic.
