  Level 1 - Exercise 1

## Description 
We need to create a data type that represents an animal. Animals have a name and “speak.” However, we must take into account that the sound of a dog's “speech” is not the same as that of a cat, for example. Therefore, we need to create other data types that help us program these behaviors among different animals.

Create at least two animals.
